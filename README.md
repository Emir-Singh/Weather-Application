#Weather-Application
This is a README file containing instructions on how to access and run the weather website I have created.

##Installation
The website can be accessed by means of copying and pasting the code in the respective HTML, CSS and JavaScript
files in this repository into your own empty HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in a code editor of your choice 
along with dowloading the error and search images. All of which are to be placed in a folder and then opened with
a live server in your code editor and the website will run as expected, offering all said functionalites and 
connecting to the external API by means of the key already placed in the JavaScript file.

Alternatively, the website can simply be accessed by clicking the link in the placed in the "about" section on the right hand side of my repository main page.
